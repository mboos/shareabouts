<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of Shareabouts, a mapping project from <a
  href="http://openplans.org/civicworks">OpenPlans</a>.</p>

<p>Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to
  collect public input on maps - for example, where should a new park be built?
  Which bus stops need a new shelter? People can put dots on the map, add
  comments, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over social
  networks.</p>

<p>This demo has been configured to collect suggestions and ideas for improving cycling
in the City of Kitchener and Region of Waterloo. At the moment, it accepts 4 different
types of feedback:</p>
